# `ripple-rest`

A simplified RESTful API for interfacing with the [Ripple Network](http://ripple.com).


See the [__Guide__](docs/GUIDE.md) and the [__API Reference__](docs/REF.md) for details on how to use the API.

## Setup

#### Test Instance

A test version of the API can be found at [`https://ripple-rest.herokuapp.com`](https://ripple-rest.herokuapp.com). 

Even though the test API supports HTTPS connections, __only submit transactions from test accounts__, we make __NO GUARANTEES__ about the security of your secret keys on this server.

#### Dependencies

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) (on a Mac use the [app](http://postgresapp.com/)). Follow the instructions [here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/server-start.html) or those that came with your PostgreSQL to get the database server running on your machine  

#### Installing

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/ripple/ripple-rest.git` in a terminal and switch into the `ripple-rest` directory
2. `cp config-example.json config.json` and configure DATABASE_URL appropriately
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and setup the database
4. Run `node server.js` to start the server
5. Visit `https://localhost:5990/api/v1/status` in your browser to confirm that the server is up and running

#### Updating

1. From the root `ripple-rest` directory run `npm install` to update to the newest version, update dependencies, and reconfigure the database
2. If the old version of the server is still running, kill the process with `CTRL-C` in the same terminal window where it is running or `killall node` to stop all Node.js processes on a Linux or Mac computer
3. Run `node server.js` to restart the server
4. Visit `http://localhost:5990/api/v1/status` in your browser to confirm that the server is up and running

#### Customization

+ Configuration options are loaded from various sources according to the following hierarchy (where 1 is the highest priority):

  1. Command line options: 

    `node server.js --DATABASE_URL=postgres://ripple_rest_user:password@localhost:5432/ripple_rest_db`

  2. Environment variables: 

    `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://ripple_rest_user:password@localhost:5432/ripple_rest_db; node server.js`

  3. The `config.json` file, which follows the format of the `config-example.json` file: 
   
  ```js
  { 
    /* ... */
    DATABASE_URL: "postgres://ripple_rest_user:password@localhost:5432/ripple_rest_db" 
    /* ... */
  }
  ```
  For more information on the `config.json` file and its versions see [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).

+ Configure the PostgreSQL connection by setting the `DATABASE_URL` field in any of the aforementioned configuration sources to a string in the following format: `postgres://ripple_rest_user:password@localhost:5432/ripple_rest_db`.

+ Configure the `rippled` connection by setting the `rippled_servers` field to a JSON object of the form:

  ```js
    "rippled_servers": [
      {
        "host": "s_west.ripple.com",
        "port": 443,
        "secure": true
      }
    ]
  ```

+ Enable SSL by including the following in the `config.json` in any of the configuration sources:

  ```js
  {
  /* ... */
    "ssl": {
      "key_path": "path/to/server.key",
      "cert_path": "path/to/server.crt"
    }
  /* ... */
  }
  ```
  Note that you will need to connect to the server with `https://` if you have SSL enabled.

+ If installing on Heroku you must add the Heroku PostgreSQL add-on first by running the command:

  `heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev`
